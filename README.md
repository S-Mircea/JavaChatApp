# JavaChatApp
Chat Application in Java Programming Language


# About the Project
This project was developed as part of the Advanced Programming module to demonstrate concepts like multithreading, socket programming, and client-server communication in Java. As a beginner in Java, I used this project to explore foundational topics and enhance my programming skills.

# Features
Server-Client Communication: Allows multiple clients to connect and chat with each other through the server.
Basic User Interface: Simple text-based command line interface for chatting.
Multithreaded Server: Handles multiple client connections simultaneously using threads.
# Prerequisites
Before running this project, make sure you have the following installed:

Java Development Kit (JDK) (version 8 or above)

A code editor or IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse)

Git (for version control and uploading to GitHub)

# Usage
Start the ChatServer first.

Then, start one or more ChatClient instances to connect to the server.

Each client can send messages to the server, and the server will broadcast these messages to all connected clients.

# File Descriptions
ChatServer.java: Contains the code for the server that handles multiple client connections using multithreading.

ChatClient.java: Contains the code for the client application that connects to the server and sends/receives messages.
